## Objective<br>

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, <br>[Travel Insurance Prediction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data)
on 23rd July 2024. The goal of the project is to build a model to predict 
if the customer will 
be interested in buying travel insurance package based on the features
given. 

## Technology Used
1. python
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn
6. GridSearch
7. Voting Classifier

## Results
The project used the Voting ensemble model, which includes, a logistic <br>
regression, a random forest model, and a support vector machine model. <br>
The model has the accuracy rate of 0.776.
